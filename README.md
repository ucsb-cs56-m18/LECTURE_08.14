# LECTURE_08.14

Today, we'll be working on User Story Mapping.

We'll sit in our teams as shown here: [Final Teams](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSPoK6OmN5yQTM0or2wmY7tEnj6auqIs1yHbJn2p6NyYPHF_PvfJZn0Rxxv4TUsdn7bVyuf8se1Hgc6/pubhtml)

As preparation, we'll be completing the worksheet [IC01](https://ucsb-cs56-m18.github.io/hwk/ic01/)

Then, 

* Our guest John Cutler will first describe Story Mapping
* He will then lead one team through the User Story Mapping exercise.  
* Then, each team will try the process for themselves.
* We'll take a moment for each team to take cell phone photos of the story maps they made (I'll keep the maps, but just in case...)
* Then we'll debrief a bit.
